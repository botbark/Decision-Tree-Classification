# Decision-Tree-Classification
Implementing Decision Tree Classification in Python

Decision tree machine learning algorithm can be used to solve not only regression but also classification problems.

This algorithm creates a tree like conditional control statements to create its model hence it is named as decision tree.

In this post we will be implementing a simple decision tree classification model using python and sklearn.
